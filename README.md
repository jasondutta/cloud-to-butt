Changes any mention of millennials to 'people under the age of 40', since by definition they were born from 1980 up until 1996. 

Then you'll see how ridiculous most of the headlines are.

We might mock them, but they are still normal people, so I, as a millennial, feel obliged to remind the world that there's a huge number of people like us out there.

We live on this planet, and deserve to be treated and respected with the difficulties that arise, and that targeting us as spoiled or entitled is just ignorant.
